## ✨ What is Snipe AI?

**Snipe AI** is a full-stack SaaS platform that brings together the online tools creators use every day —  
so you don’t have to jump between dozens of websites.

Instead of bookmarking random tools, **Snipe AI gives you one centralized system** for:

- 🖼️ AI image background & object removal  
- 🎥 AI video utilities (cleanup, processing, enhancement)  
- ⬇️ Mass media downloading (YouTube, Spotify, Pinterest, MP3, etc.)  
- 🔐 Secure user authentication  
- ⚙️ A scalable backend built for future AI integrations  

This project started as a **personal productivity tool** and is being developed into a **real SaaS product**.

## 🧠 Why this exists

Creators today rely on:
- Too many single-purpose tools
- Inconsistent UIs
- Scattered workflows
- Questionable reliability

**Snipe AI solves this by:**
- Centralizing tools
